# Thermodynamics-Project

Problem Statement- 
Write a program which gives stability of Fe₃O₄, FeO and Fe in a graph showing
Temperature vs PH​₂ / (pH​₂+ PH​₂O). Consider the range of temperature from 300K to
1500K.

In this project, we have calculated the stability of Fe₃O₄​, FeO and Fe between the temperature
ranging from 300K to 1500K and have plotted the results accordingly using python
